Usage:

1. Edit `index.html` and replace the `token` and `username` variables with your own Twitch credentials. You can generate an oauth token via [Twitch Chat OAuth](https://twitchapps.com/tmi). You can also edit the default value attribute on the `#channel` input field with a comma separated list of whatever chat channels you want to "watch".
2. Open `index.html` in your favorite browser.
3. Enjoy!

* __Custom Channels:__ Finalize the ability to type in your own list of a channels to connect to. It partially works right now, but there are some JS errors that can occur under certain scenarios... "this is beyond my skill to heal" ;)
